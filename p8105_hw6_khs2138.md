# Problem 1

The *Washington Post* has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository
[here](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides). You can read
their accompanying article
[here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/where-murders-go-unsolved/).

## Import and Clean Homicide Data

- Create a `city_state` variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”)
- Create a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved
- Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t
  report victim race.
- Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake.
- Limit your analysis those for whom `victim_race` is `white` or
  `black`. Be sure that `victim_age` is numeric.

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv('./data/homicide-data.csv') |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city,state, sep = ", "),
         solved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) |>
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White","Black")) |>
  filter(!city_state %in% 
           c("Dallas, TX","Phoenix, AZ","Kansas City, MO","Tulsa, AL")) |>
  mutate(victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race),
         victim_sex = fct_relevel(victim_sex, "Female"))
```

## GLM Baltimore

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the `glm` function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors. Save the output of `glm` as an R object;
apply the `broom::tidy` to this object; and obtain the estimate and
confidence interval of the adjusted **odds ratio** for solving homicides
comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables
fixed.

``` r
baltimore_logistic = homicide_data |> 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |>
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = _, family = binomial()) 

baltimore_logistic |>
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |>
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) |>
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value, conf.low, conf.high) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term             | log_OR |    OR | p.value | conf.low | conf.high |
|:-----------------|-------:|------:|--------:|---------:|----------:|
| (Intercept)      |  0.310 | 1.363 |   0.070 |   -0.025 |     0.648 |
| victim_age       | -0.007 | 0.993 |   0.043 |   -0.013 |     0.000 |
| victim_sexMale   | -0.854 | 0.426 |   0.000 |   -1.126 |    -0.584 |
| victim_raceWhite |  0.842 | 2.320 |   0.000 |    0.501 |     1.187 |

Homicides with male victims are less likely to be solved than those with
female victims.

## City-wise GLM

Now run `glm` for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use
of `purrr::map`, list columns, and `unnest` as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.
