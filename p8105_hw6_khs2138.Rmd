# Problem 1

The _Washington Post_ has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides). You can read their accompanying article [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/where-murders-go-unsolved/).

## Import and Clean Homicide Data
* Create a `city_state` variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”)
* Create a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved
* Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO -- these don't report victim race. 
* Also omit Tulsa, AL -- this is a data entry mistake. 
* Limit your analysis those for whom `victim_race` is `white` or `black`. Be sure that `victim_age` is numeric. 

```{r load_tidy}
homicide_data = read_csv('./data/homicide-data.csv') |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city,state, sep = ", "),
         solved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) |>
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White","Black")) |>
  filter(!city_state %in% 
           c("Dallas, TX","Phoenix, AZ","Kansas City, MO","Tulsa, AL")) |>
  mutate(victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race),
         victim_sex = fct_relevel(victim_sex, "Female"))

```


## GLM Baltimore 

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the `glm` function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors. Save the output of `glm` as an R object; apply the `broom::tidy` to this object; and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted **odds ratio** for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed. 

```{r baltimore_glm}
baltimore_logistic = homicide_data |> 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |>
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = _, family = binomial()) 

baltimore_logistic |>
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |>
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) |>
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value, conf.low, conf.high) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

```

Homicides with male victims are less likely to be solved than those with female victims. 

## City-wise GLM
Now run `glm` for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of `purrr::map`, list columns, and `unnest` as necessary to create a dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city. 
                             

```{r city_glm}
city_logistic = homicide_data |>
  nest(data = -city_state) |>
  mutate(glm = map(data, \(data) glm(solved ~ victim_sex + victim_race + victim_age,  
                                     data = data) |>
                     broom::tidy(conf.int=TRUE, exp = TRUE))) |>
  unnest(glm) |>
  mutate(OR = estimate) |>
  select(city_state, term, OR, p.value, conf.low, conf.high) |>
  filter(term %in% c("victim_sex","victim_sexMale","victim_sexFemale"))

city_logistic |>
  knitr::kable()

```



```{r, eval = FALSE}
city_logistic |>
  group_by(city_state, term, OR) |>
  summarize(ci_lower = quantile(OR, 0.025),
         ci_upper = quantile(OR, 0.975))
```

## Plot OR and CIs 
Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city. Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

```{r plot_or_cis}
city_logistic |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(city_state, OR), y = OR)) + geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

There are only a few cities, including Albuquerque and Stockholm, where homocides are more likely to be solved for men than women. In most cities, the odds ratio are in favor of homicides being solved for female victims. 



# Problem 2
For this problem, we'll use the Central Park weather data similar to data we've seen elsewhere. The code chunk below (adapted from the course website) will download these data. 

```{r weather_data}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2022-01-01",
    date_max = "2022-12-31") |>
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) |>
  select(name, id, everything())
```

The boostrap is helpful when you'd like to perform inference for a parameter / value / summary that doesn't have an easy-to-write-down distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. We'll focus on a simple linear regression with `tmax` as the response with `tmin` and `prcp` as the predictors, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities estimated from these data:


* $\hat{r}^2$
* $\log(\hat{\beta}_1 * \hat{\beta}_2)$

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce estimates of these two quantities. Plot the distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words. Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for $\hat{r}^2$ and $\log(\hat{\beta}_0 * \hat{\beta}_1)$. Note: `broom::glance()` is helpful for extracting $\hat{r}^2$ from a fitted regression, and `broom::tidy()` (with some additional wrangling) should help in computing $\log(\hat{\beta}_1 * \hat{\beta}_2)$. 

**Generate bootstrap samples**
```{r}
boot_sample = function(df) {
  sample_frac(df, replace = TRUE)
}

boot_straps = 
  tibble(strap_number = 1:1000) |> 
  mutate(
    strap_sample = map(strap_number, \(i) boot_sample(df = weather_df))
  )

boot_straps
```

**Apply logistic regression to bootstraps and extract desired estimates**

```{r bootstrap_model}
bootstrap_lm = 
  boot_straps |> 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap_sample, \(df) lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data = df)))

bootstrap_betas = bootstrap_lm |>
  mutate(results = map(models, broom::tidy)) |> 
  select(-strap_sample, -models) |> 
  unnest(results) |>
  group_by(strap_number) |>
  summarize(beta_prod = estimate[term == "tmin"] * estimate[term == "prcp"]) |>
  mutate(log_beta_prod = log(beta_prod)) |>
  select(-beta_prod)

bootstrap_rsquared = bootstrap_lm |>
  mutate(results = map(models, broom::glance)) |> 
  select(-strap_sample, -models) |> 
  unnest(results) |>
  select(strap_number, r.squared)
```


**Plot estimates**
```{r plot_rsquared}
bootstrap_rsquared |>
  ggplot(aes(x = r.squared)) + geom_histogram()
  
```


```{r plot_betas}
bootstrap_betas |>
  ggplot(aes(x = log_beta_prod)) + geom_histogram()
  
```


## Todo: Update to 5000 and add CI
